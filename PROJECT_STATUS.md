# ForgeShape — Project Status

**Status Version:** 0.15.4
**Updated:** 2026-08-20
**Result:** COMPLETE
**Current Phase:** Phase 1 — Native Viewport
**Workspace:** `D:\TRAVELAPPS\ForgeShape`
**Accepted implementation baseline:** Stage 014 (`5d386f0`), plus the NDK r29
migration (Gate P0) and the owner decision baseline (`dd98e01`)
**Next Stage:** Stage 015B — UI/UX Architecture Foundation Implementation

This is a current snapshot, not a chronology. Per-stage verification chapters,
superseded environment states and old next-stage recommendations live in Git
history and are deliberately not repeated here.

Nothing since Stage 014 has changed product behaviour. Gate P0 was toolchain-only
(one line in `app/build.gradle`), Stage 015A-R was an audit and design revision,
and the owner decision baseline was documentation only.

## Owner Decision Baseline

Active owner decisions are identified by `UI-OWNER-*`, `ARCH-OWNER-*`,
`INPUT-OWNER-*` and `DOC-OWNER-*`. Recorded 2026-08-20. **Nothing in this section
is implemented** — it states what was decided, not what the product does.

The historical bare `D1`–`D6` tables from Stage 015A and Stage 015A-R are
**superseded and non-authoritative**, and the two tables did not even mean the
same things, which is why bare `D` numbers were retired. No stage gate,
acceptance table or preflight may cite a bare `D` number again.

| ID | Decision | Approved value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| UI-OWNER-01 | Shell family | **Forge Shell** — a modernized viewport-first shell: direct edge controls and a Tool Rail for Sculpt, the same shell language plus a contextual exact-value Property Inspector for Construction. One shell; mode and tool decide content, never structure. |
| UI-OWNER-02 | Device scope | **phone + tablet** — Stage 015B implements adaptive compact / medium / expanded behaviour now. A tablet may dock more surfaces but must not become desktop-CAD clutter. |
| UI-OWNER-03 | Export placement | **global action** — Construction, Sculpt and UV remain editing contexts; Export is not one of them and later opens its own output surface. |
| UI-OWNER-04 | Sketch + Extrude | **approved as an iterative CAD workflow**, not implemented and not part of Stage 015B geometry. See below. |
| UI-OWNER-05 | Confirmation before a destructive re-Freeze | **yes**, and **only** when existing Frozen Sculpt Mesh edits would actually be replaced. A normal Resume Sculpt has no confirmation — it destroys nothing, and guarding it would train the user to dismiss the guard that matters. |
| UI-OWNER-06 | Stylus pressure in Stage 015B | **no** — deferred to a dedicated Sculpt stage. 015B must still be stylus-friendly and preserve a clean path for pressure, tilt and hover. |
| ARCH-OWNER-01 | Future Apple portability | **required architectural constraint**. See below. |
| INPUT-OWNER-01 | Stylus-first interaction | **required product/architecture constraint**. See below. |
| DOC-OWNER-01 | Clear naming and code comments | **required documentation/maintainability rule**, recorded durably in `CLAUDE.md`. |

**UI-OWNER-04 in detail.** A Construction Body may begin either from an exact
primitive **or** from a 2D sketch: standard sketch planes (later on planar
Construction faces), multiple sketches on different planes, Line/Polyline,
Rectangle, Circle, select/delete, grid and snap, exact numeric entry, closed-
profile detection and validation, and repeated Sketch → Extrude workflows. The
first Extrude vertical slice supports **New Body**; Extrude **Add** and **Cut**
are required integration **after** boolean infrastructure exists. The result stays
Construction source and history until an explicit Freeze to Sculpt. **This
approval is not permission for** a geometric constraint solver, assemblies,
NURBS, engineering drawings, Revolve, Fillet, Chamfer or Shell — each needs its
own approval.

**ARCH-OWNER-01 in detail.** Android remains the **first production platform**.
Construction, Geometry, Sculpt and domain code stay platform-neutral C++; Android
`View`/`Activity`/JNI types never become domain truth; the Android UI is a
platform shell/adapter; input crossing the boundary moves toward semantic,
platform-neutral pointer/tool samples; future file and platform services sit
behind narrow boundaries; renderer/platform-surface coupling stays explicit.
**Not authorized now:** an iOS/iPadOS application, an Xcode project, a Metal
backend, a MoltenVK dependency, or a cross-platform UI framework. A future Apple
UI may be native to Apple — sharing Android View code is not a goal — and the
Apple render path is deliberately undecided, belonging to a later evidence-based
spike. The architectural consequences are owned by `ARCHITECTURE.md`.

**INPUT-OWNER-01 in detail.** ForgeShape must stay comfortable for finger input,
for an Android stylus/S Pen, for tablets and for a future Apple Pencil: touch
targets practical for both a stylus tip and a fingertip, a shell that does not
unnecessarily cover the model, explicit gesture ownership between viewport,
chrome and tool, and a semantic input boundary able to carry pressure, tilt,
hover and tool type. Stage 015B does **not** change Sculpt deformation from
pressure.

**DOC-OWNER-01 in detail.** The rule itself lives in `CLAUDE.md`; the fixed UI
vocabulary is *Editor Workspace*, *Global Toolbar*, *Tool Rail*, *Property
Inspector*, *Construction Body*, *Frozen Sculpt Mesh*. Existing working code is
not mass-renamed for it.

## Product Direction

ForgeShape is an author-owned offline 3D modeling/sculpting application.
Production architecture must NOT use Godot, GDExtension, Unity, Unreal or any
other general-purpose engine that owns the viewport or render loop.

## Environment and toolchain

| | pinned / installed |
| --- | --- |
| JDK | 21.0.9 (Android Studio JBR, `JAVA_HOME`) |
| Android SDK | `C:\Users\damia\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk`; platforms 33/34/35/36/36.1 |
| Build tools | 36.1.0 in use (27.0.0, 33.0.3, 35.0.0, 35.0.1 also installed) |
| **NDK** | **pinned to `29.0.14206865`** in `app/build.gradle`. 25.2.9519653 and 27.2.12479018 are also installed but unused. An r30 beta is prohibited. |
| CMake | 3.22.1 in use (4.1.2 also installed) |
| Gradle / AGP | 8.14.3 wrapper / 8.13.2 |
| SDK levels | compileSdk 36, targetSdk 36, minSdk 26 |
| ABI filter | `x86_64` only |
| C++ / STL | C++17, `c++_static`; one packaged `.so`, `lib/x86_64/libforgeshape_native.so` |
| Shaders | `glslc` at `<ndk>/shader-tools/windows-x86_64/glslc.exe`, AOT from CMake |
| System images | only `system-images;android-36.1;google_apis_playstore;x86_64` |

No Godot/GDExtension files remain in the workspace.

**Git.** The root repository is initialized, **local only**: no remote, nothing
pushed, and no global Git config — the committer identity lives in `.git/config`
alone. Baseline commit `5d386f03e7b33de47ea717a4a1d629231b073b56`
(`baseline: accepted Stage 014`, 171 files). `.gitignore` excludes Gradle/CMake/
NDK output, `.cxx`, `.gradle`, IDE state, `local.properties` and APK/AAB output.
It deliberately does **not** ignore `artifacts/`, which holds the runtime
evidence screenshots cited by past stage acceptance.

### Android runtime targets

| AVD / serial | Status |
| --- | --- |
| `Medium_Phone_API_36.1` / `emulator-5554` | **Reserved by another program.** ForgeShape must not use, start, stop, wipe, reconfigure, install to, send input to, log or screenshot it until the owner lifts this. |
| `ForgeShape_Stage004` / `emulator-5556` | **Contended, non-authoritative.** Another program runs `com.damian.wlochyikafalonia.claude.debug` on it, steals the foreground and injects taps that reach ForgeShape. Do not use it for authoritative evidence; do not stop, wipe or reconfigure it. |
| `ForgeShape_Stage006` / `emulator-5558` | **Current ForgeShape-owned evidence target.** Isolated, own AVD definition and data dir. |

`emulator-5558` is pixel_6, 1080×2400, density 420, multi-touch, GPU host,
`x86_64`, API 36 (`google_apis_playstore`). Vulkan: loader instance 1.4.0,
physical device "Goldfish GFXStream (AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT)", device API 1.3.0,
swapchain format 37 (`R8G8B8A8_UNORM`), 4 images, FIFO.

Rules that apply to every run:

- Every `adb` command names its target explicitly: `adb -s <serial> ...`.
- Launch the emulator **detached** (e.g. WMI `Win32_Process.Create`); it dies if
  spawned as a child of a tool shell.
- Before any evidence-sensitive input or screenshot, confirm ForgeShape is the
  resumed activity; invalidate any run contaminated by foreign input.
- Creating a new AVD from already-installed tooling is allowed; installing or
  updating SDK/NDK/JDK/system images is not.
- `adb root` is unavailable on Play Store images, so `sendevent` injection is
  impossible; multi-touch is injected with the on-device `uinput` tool, which
  consumes concatenated JSON objects (no array, no commas).

## Architecture

`ARCHITECTURE.md` is the authoritative ownership map. In one paragraph: a
standalone Android application (`com.forgeshape.app`) with a Java shell that owns
no domain truth, a plain `SurfaceView` viewport, a JNI boundary that carries
whole sections and semantic pointer samples, and a platform-neutral C++17 domain
(`ConstructionObject` and its five primitives, `ConstructionTransform`,
`SculptSession` and its one brush kernel, `MeshStore`, picking, selection,
camera) beneath a native Vulkan renderer that owns no geometry truth. No Compose,
no AndroidX, no third-party runtime library, no engine.

## Verified capability matrix

Everything below is verified at runtime on `emulator-5558` through the real
Android touch path. `PRODUCT.md` owns the user-facing description.

| Capability | State |
| --- | --- |
| Vulkan viewport, swapchain, depth, pipeline, indexed draw, surface recreation | VERIFIED |
| Camera: orbit / pan / pinch, pointer-set re-anchoring, cancel handling | VERIFIED |
| Tap-to-select, tap-to-clear, drag and multi-touch never select | VERIFIED |
| CPU picking follows camera, dimensions, transform and sculpt deformation | VERIFIED |
| Dynamic mesh: immutable revisions, fail-closed validation, capacity reuse/growth | VERIFIED |
| One Construction Body with exact Box / Cylinder / Sphere / Cone / Capsule | VERIFIED |
| Exact dimensions in meters; mm/cm/m display unit above JNI only, lossless | VERIFIED |
| Apply Shape: Applied / Unchanged / Rejected, atomic, kind change is a change | VERIFIED |
| Every primitive's parameters remembered independently across kind changes | VERIFIED |
| Capsule relation (`totalHeight >= diameter`) rejected in words, object unchanged | VERIFIED |
| Capsule equality case generated as a sphere (482 : 2880) | VERIFIED |
| Position/rotation transform, degrees, right-hand rule, local X→Y→Z | VERIFIED |
| Transform-only edit publishes no revision and triggers no GPU upload | VERIFIED |
| Freeze to Sculpt / Back to Construction / Resume Sculpt without re-freezing | VERIFIED |
| Stale-source policy: Construction change never touches the sculpt mesh | VERIFIED |
| Four sculpt tools (Grab, Clay, Smooth, Inflate) on one shared kernel | VERIFIED |
| Shared Radius and Strength, clamped, unchanged by tool switching | VERIFIED |
| Clay ≠ Inflate, measured (start-normal vs current-normal) | VERIFIED |
| Pending-then-promote: multi-touch navigation cannot mutate the sculpt mesh | VERIFIED |
| Sculpt topology fixed; buffers reused, never reallocated during a stroke | VERIFIED |
| Construction Source bit-identical after sculpting with all four tools | VERIFIED |
| Lifecycle: shape, placement, identity, unit, mode, tool, sculpt, camera and selection survive home/resume with no re-upload | VERIFIED |
| 16 KB page-size runtime behaviour | **UNVERIFIED** — see Known Issues |

## Self-test suite

Nine debug-only native suites run once from `NativeViewport.start()` — never per
frame — and totalled **992 checks, zero failures** at the accepted baseline under
NDK r29:

| suite token | checks |
| --- | --- |
| `FORGESHAPE_CAMERA_SELFTEST_OK` | 38 |
| `FORGESHAPE_PICKING_SELFTEST_OK` | 94 |
| `FORGESHAPE_DYNAMIC_MESH_SELFTEST_OK` | 91 |
| `FORGESHAPE_CONSTRUCTION_BOX_SELFTEST_OK` | 100 |
| `FORGESHAPE_CONSTRUCTION_TRANSFORM_SELFTEST_OK` | 94 |
| `FORGESHAPE_CONSTRUCTION_PRIMITIVE_SELFTEST_OK` | 75 |
| `FORGESHAPE_CONSTRUCTION_SPHERE_SELFTEST_OK` | 105 |
| `FORGESHAPE_CONE_CAPSULE_SELFTEST_OK` | 163 |
| `FORGESHAPE_SCULPT_BRUSH_KERNEL_SELFTEST_OK` | 232 |

followed by `FORGESHAPE_MESH_UPLOAD_OK` and `FORGESHAPE_NATIVE_VIEWPORT_OK`.
Build and verification commands are in `README.md`.

## Current evidence summary

- **Stage 014 acceptance** (`emulator-5558`, one pid, empty crash buffer): the
  cone and capsule happy paths, closed-base and hemisphere picking measured at
  the pixel against the exact radius, the capsule relation rejection, no-op and
  invalid handling, transform-only edits publishing nothing, the five-kind round
  trip preserving `objectId=1` and every remembered parameter, and the
  stale-source policy across a capsule → cone change with a pixel-identical
  resumed sculpt.
- **Gate P0 (NDK r27 → r29)**: `compileDebugJavaWithJavac`, `buildCMakeDebug` and
  `packageDebug` all succeeded first time with **no migration fix of any kind** —
  the whole migration is one line. Nine suites / 992 checks green, plus an
  integration smoke (Construction Apply, transform-only edit, transformed cone
  picking inside the facet band, Freeze, one real `uinput` Grab stroke with
  fixed topology and `reuse` uploads throughout, Construction ↔ Sculpt
  preservation, and a byte-identical HOME/resume screenshot).
- **16 KB page size**: ELF LOAD alignment moved from `0x1000` (r27, not
  compatible) to `0x4000` (r29, compatible) on all three segments;
  `zipalign -c -P 16 -v 4` verification successful with the `.so` stored
  uncompressed; a source/config audit found no page-size assumption anywhere and
  no third-party native library in the APK. Normal (4 KB) runtime smoke PASS.
  **16 KB runtime remains UNVERIFIED.**
- Runtime evidence screenshots are retained under `artifacts/`.

## Known Issues / Blockers

- **16 KB page-size runtime behaviour is UNVERIFIED.** Static, ELF and APK
  evidence all pass, but no 16 KB Android runtime is available: `emulator-5558`
  reports `getconf PAGE_SIZE` = 4096 and the only installed system image is a
  4 KB one. Closing this needs
  `system-images;android-36.1;google_apis_playstore_ps16k;x86_64` and an AVD
  created from it, and installing a system image is not authorized. Not a defect
  — an unmeasured dimension.
- **Landscape is a hard failure, not a degradation.** The Construction panel
  measures to the full window, the model is entirely occluded (0 % viewport
  unoccluded at 914×411 dp against 51 % in portrait), and the status line — the
  only channel for validation messages and the stale-source warning — lays out
  below the window bottom with no `ScrollView` anywhere in the Android layer to
  reach it. `configChanges` absorbs `orientation|screenSize|screenLayout|density`
  and there is no `onConfigurationChanged` and no `WindowInsets` handling at all;
  under `targetSdk` 36 the inset gap is latent rather than hypothetical. The
  portrait IME case works and is a deliberate strength to preserve. Stage 015B
  owns this.
- **The Android layer has no automated test of any kind**, and almost no stable
  view ids (`setId` appears twice, both `RadioGroup` internals). Every UI
  assertion so far has been driven by hand through screen coordinates.
  `setContentDescription` *is* populated on 7 control families and is the
  immediate test bridge.
- **Test-harness note, not a product defect:** a stroke driven at the centre of a
  face of a frozen **box** logs `STROKE_PENDING` → `STROKE_ABANDONED:navigation`
  and never promotes, because a box has 8 vertices, all at its corners, and a
  brush that would capture no vertex starts no stroke. Reproduced identically
  under r27 and r29. Drive evidence strokes on a dense primitive (sphere 482 v,
  capsule 514 v) or widen the radius.
- **A viewport tap while the soft keyboard is up** must land below the panel and
  above the keyboard or it never reaches the `SurfaceView`; focus stays in the
  text field and a following `keyevent` types a digit instead. Looks exactly like
  a command that did not run. Test-harness issue only.
- **The default logcat ring buffer drops part of the startup self-test output.**
  Run `adb -s <serial> logcat -G 16M` first.
- **The Android emulator dies if launched as a child of a tool shell**; spawn it
  detached.
- Android input resampling can emit a one-finger MOVE between `ACTION_DOWN` and
  `ACTION_POINTER_DOWN`, so starting a two-finger gesture may orbit by a few
  pixels first. Correct for the contract, not a defect.
- The path-driven tools deposit in proportion to pointer travel measured in brush
  radii, so a **short stroke with a large brush** does very little — the one
  thing that reads as "the brush did nothing" on a first try. Documented
  behaviour, not a defect.
- The arbitration's remaining deliberate seam: a first finger that **drags more
  than 8 px** before a second one lands does commit a stroke. That is a gesture
  the user drove as a stroke; closing it completely needs a buffered or undoable
  stroke, which does not exist.
- On `emulator-5558`, `screencap` output can acquire a uniform whole-framebuffer
  black-level lift partway through a session. It is a system/compositing effect,
  not a rendering change — the swapchain format is unchanged and home/resume
  within one display state stays byte-identical — but it means screenshots from
  different points in a session may not compare.

## Technical Debt

**Sculpt cost model.** Sculpt publication is synchronous and republishes the
whole mesh per move — O(vertices) regardless of how few the brush touched — and
Inflate's normal recompute is O(triangles) per move for the same reason. Measured
free at 482–514 vertices (1,170 uploads, no stall, no growth), so nothing was
redesigned pre-emptively; that measurement is the baseline a future partial or
asynchronous path must beat. The affected set is found by a linear scan at stroke
start, and picking is a linear scan too: both want the same missing spatial
acceleration.

**Sculpt state and feel.** Sculpt state is process-scoped with no save, load or
undo, so a stroke is unrecoverable the moment it lands and Freeze silently
discards the previous sculpt (the panel says so; the honest fix is undo). The
path-driven gain constants (`kNormalBrushGain` 0.35, `kSmoothGain` 1.0,
`kMaxSmoothLambda` 0.9) are chosen, not derived, and have never been tuned
against a real modelling session; if brush feel is tuned they should move
together. `FORGESHAPE_SCULPT_STROKE_ABANDONED:navigation` names two different
causes — a gesture that really became navigation, and a promoted stroke that
captured no vertex — and the log cannot tell them apart; the fix is a second
token, not a behaviour change. Freeze regenerates the Construction mesh to copy
it rather than copying the store's current revision: correct (the store may hold
a debug fixture) and cheap, but a second generation of geometry that already
exists. The Sculpt panel's status line is written on refresh and does not update
during a stroke, because a live readout would need a native→Java notification
that does not exist.

**Primitive surface.** Adding a primitive costs four parallel edits — a member on
`ConstructionObject`, a `PrimitiveKind` case, a variant alternative, and a JNI
method plus its Java declaration. That is deliberate and visible rather than
hidden behind a registry, but at a sixth primitive it should be a decision rather
than a habit. `ConstructionObject::setPrimitive` still dispatches with an if-else
chain over the typed accessors rather than a `std::visit`, because the per-kind
members are not uniform; it is the one place a new primitive can be forgotten
without a compile error. Every primitive's parameters are always resident even
though one is active. Tessellation is a compile-time constant, so a very large
curved primitive shows its facets and nothing adapts; relatedly, the capsule's
cylindrical middle carries no interior rings however long it is, which makes
sculpt fidelity there coarse (a 120 px brush captured 8 vertices on a 514-vertex
capsule), and the float-resolvability check is the one validation coupled to that
tessellation constant. Capsule topology is a function of its parameters (514 :
3072, or 482 : 2880 at equality), which is deliberate and is also the only case
where a shape edit can change a vertex count and trigger a buffer growth.

**Android layer.** Both panels build their view trees in code with hard-coded
colours and spacing, because the project ships no resource layouts or theme; both
are fixed `WRAP_CONTENT` blocks with no scroll and no collapse, verified at
1080×2400 portrait only; and `SculptPanelView` duplicates `ConstructionPanelView`'s
styling helpers (two panels is not yet a reason for a shared base — a third
would be). `ConstructionPanelView` is 1041 of the Android layer's 2223 lines. The
panel's top edge can hide part of the object and there is no focus-on-selection,
camera framing helper or viewport inset. Focus handling is minimal: a field keeps
focus after a rejected Apply and keeps swallowing hardware/`adb` number keys
until the viewport is touched. The panel refreshes from native truth on resume,
discarding any half-typed edit — deliberate, but a future edit-session or undo
feature will need a model for it. `LengthUnit.format` strips trailing zeros, so
2.0 m displays as `2`; exact and unambiguous, but a future significant-figures
policy will replace it.

**Transform and math.** `modelMatrix()` / `inverseModelMatrix()` recompute six
trig calls per frame and per pick, for a value that only changes on Apply. The
transform is rigid by design: the exact composed inverse and the "local distance
is world distance" shortcut in picking both depend on that, so adding scale is a
domain change rather than a matrix change. A large translation makes the float
round-trip residual grow linearly with `|p|` (about `|p| * 2^-23`); at kilometre
scale the derived `float` matrix, not the `double` domain, is the precision
limit.

**Mesh and renderer.** `MeshStore` publishes for exactly one object; there is no
multi-mesh registry. `MeshStore::publish` validates the data twice (before
taking the lock and again inside `createRuntimeMesh`) — negligible now, wasteful
at sculpt sizes. Retired GPU buffers are freed inline after the fence wait rather
than through a deferred-destruction queue, which is what makes the synchronous
wait necessary. One redundant swapchain rebuild occurs at startup and again on
each resume, because `surfaceChanged` arrives immediately after `surfaceCreated`
(cosmetic). Carried and untouched: static viewport and scissor, no `oldSwapchain`
handling, no validation layers, a single global viewport, and a selection
highlight that is a whole-object tint rather than an outline.

**Naming and test infrastructure.** `kConstructionBoxObjectId` and
`kDemoCubeObjectId` are the same value under two names and are now doubly
misnamed: the object is not always a box and never was a demo cube. Renaming has
been deferred to avoid churning unrelated code. There is still no checked-in
`uinput` harness file, so the multi-touch gesture is regenerated per stage.

## Next Stage

**Stage 015B — UI/UX Architecture Foundation Implementation**

The decision baseline is recorded, so 015B starts with no open question about
what to build. It builds the **Forge Shell** (UI-OWNER-01) as an adaptive
compact/medium/expanded Editor Workspace (UI-OWNER-02), with Export as a global
action (UI-OWNER-03), a confirmation on a genuinely destructive re-Freeze and
none on Resume (UI-OWNER-05), no stylus pressure (UI-OWNER-06), and reserved but
visibly disabled homes for the Sketch/Extrude workflow (UI-OWNER-04). It is a UI
stage: no geometry, no Sketch, no Extrude, no boolean, no Apple target.

Two constraints bind it that did not bind earlier stages. ARCH-OWNER-01 means the
shell is a platform adapter and may not become domain truth — anything 015B
appears to need from native code that is not already exposed is a signal it is
drifting into the domain. INPUT-OWNER-01 means the shell must be usable with a
stylus and must not close the door on pressure, tilt, hover and tool type, even
though it consumes none of them yet.

Two tests should land with the shell rather than after it, because they are what
would have caught by machine what the audit found by hand: **U9** — viewport
floor and reachability at four window sizes — and **U10** — a drag on any chrome
surface produces no camera change and no `SculptRevision`.
